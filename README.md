# DOS-Attack

Tis repository demonstrates a simple dos attack on a python server. DOS stands for denial of service i.e. we do not let the server respond to the client or do not let the
client connect to the server. There are many ways to perform a dos attack, the method chosen here is TCP SYN flood. 

Trying a dos attack against any server that isn't your own or that which you are not authorized to attack will get you into legal trouble.
